<p><big>Hi 
       <br>
       <br>
         My name is Yinn. I'm 13 and right now I'm attending in <b>EDUSN.</b> For educational support, I'm learning the <b>extra english and mathematic, too.</b> My english class is from <b>The Student Language Academy.</b> The founder of our school is called Sir Micheal Lin Lin and sometimes he teaches by himself on every Wednesday. My math class is from <b>The Glory Hope.</b> Our teacher name is called Sir Paing Zay Phyo. All of the teachers are kind and nice. They all explain when we don't understand. When we absent, the teachers send us the lessons back so you won't miss any lessons at all. So thank you for reading about my schools. I hope you all enjoy. 
       <br>

	   See you soon,
	   Yinn
